# NoodleMap

Audio perambulation android app that allows the user to record geotagged audio and to wander in a soundscape made of geolocated objects.

Work in progress. Please ignore the mess and the lack of comments.

This project is part of a nomadic development challenge. 
It has been writen, compiled and carefully crafted directly on an android device using Aide IDE.
